# COVID-19-Tracker
A GUI application for tracking the rates of COVID-19 throughout the world. 

COVID-19 Tracker takes in a max of 5 countries and a specified time range to display a graph 
of the COVID-19 cases in all of those countries. It color codes each of the countries in the graph,
allowing the user to easily compare the rates of COVID-19 throughout the world. This works for any 
time range that the user inputs. 

The user also has the option to display a world map of the COVID-19 
rates after the graph is created, allowing the data on COVID-19 to be visualized in an appealing and 
intuitive way that is user-friendly. Each of the countries in the world map is colored to the extent 
of its COVID-19 rates, allowing the user to easily see which countries need to take action and which
ones do not.
