DISCLAIMER: Due to the limits of the API this uses, data for certain dates in the past will now no longer be available due to the historical data limit that this API has. 

IMPORTANT: when you download it, make sure the .exe file and the earth.ico icon image are in the SAME directory! Also keep the .json files that the app makes in the same directory as well! Otherwise it will not work!

-----HOW TO GET-----

To install, click on the "COVID-19 Installer.exe" file above and click the "download" button. This is an installer so you have to choose where you want to install this app in your computer. It is recommended that you create a folder to install this app in, as it requires an icon image to function. IMPORTANT NOTE: Your antivirus will most likely see this app as a threat but it isn't, so you will most likely have to prevent your antivirus from blocking this app if it does so. When you run the app, note that it will take about 1 minute to start running and you will see a black terminal window before the actual app comes up. IMPORTANT: when you download it, make sure the .exe file and the earth.ico icon image are in the SAME directory! Otherwise it will not work!

-----HOW TO USE-----

Type in the names of the countries you want to graph and make sure to spell them correctly. Input the start dates and end dates to make the time range on which the graph will be based. The app also gives real-time COVID-19 updates in the U.S. If you search a country and the graph is a straight line at zero, then you most likely spelled the country wrong or there is no data on it. 

-----ABOUT-----

COVID-19 Tracker takes in a max of 5 countries and a specified time range to display a graph 
of the COVID-19 cases in all of those countries. It color codes each of the countries in the graph,
allowing the user to easily compare the rates of COVID-19 throughout the world. This works for any 
time range that the user inputs.
